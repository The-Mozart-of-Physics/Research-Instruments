# Research-Insturments
Repository destinated to share codes that intend to control research instruments (ex: pyvisa)

The first program was written with the intention of control Thor Labs' ELL18 during the class SPECTRO - Research Workshop at Sorbonne University, Paris. Improvements will be made in the future.
